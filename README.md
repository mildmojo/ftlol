## ABOUT THE GAME

FTLOL is a journey through space. You are the artificially-intelligent steward
of a colony ship set for the Ryan system, whose primary cargo is some 20,000
meatbags in cryo-sleep. This is going to take a couple hundred years.

As problems arise, you need to improvise solutions using the ship's limited
stores. ALL CARGO IS FAIR GAME.

## CONTROLS

Controls: Mouse-based. Escape or Self Destruct to quit. Drag inside list boxes
to scroll them.

## HOW TO PLAY

How to play: When a problem arises, select items from your cargo monitor (top left) and add them to the repair staging monitor using the '>>>' button. Check the projected outcome display at bottom right. If your selection fills any one of the meters, "OK" will appear, and you can safely press "ACCEPT".

You may press "ACCEPT" with a sub-optimal solution, but it will decrease the life of your ship. You may not make it.

## NOTES

We had a lot more in mind for this game, but hit a number of serious issues on the coding side that slowed things down. The content producers were top-notch, building a library of art and sound at breakneck pace. Mildmojo deeply regrets getting so wedged on things that should've been much easier. Number of serious Unity bugs encountered: 2.
